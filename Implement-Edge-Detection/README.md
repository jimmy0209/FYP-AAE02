# Canny Edge Detection
```
This project is trying to implement Canny Edge Detection
```
### Canny Edge Detection
```
Input image: input_image.jpg
Command line >> python Canny_Edge_Detection.py  -i input_image.png
```

The program will show the result include original image and result image. 
```
NOTE: The running time for this program is about 10 sec on macbook-pro
